#+title:    :ui smooth-scroll

#+created:  April 1, 2025
#+since:    25.05.0

* Description :unfold:
This module activates OS-independent smooth scrolling in Emacs. This primarily
benefits trackpad and scroll wheel users (not so much those that scroll via
their keyboards), by utilizing the [[https://github.com/jdtsmith/ultra-scroll][ultra-scroll]] package.

#+begin_quote
  For optimal performance from this module, it's highly recommended you use
    Emacs with native-compilation. MacOS users may also have a better experience
    using the [[https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac][emacs-mac]] fork of Emacs, available via Homebrew.

* Troubleshooting
This module should work on any platform that provides pixel-level scrolling
information from your input hardware, but if you run into issues, here are some
things to try:

- Use ~M-x ultra-scroll-check~ to diagnose common issues. Visit [[https://github.com/jdtsmith/ultra-scroll?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility][ultra-scroll's
  documentation]] for more on interpreting and acting on its results.
- Read ultra-scroll's documentation on [[https://github.com/jdtsmith/ultra-scroll?tab=readme-ov-file#Speed][scrolling speed]]; it outlines common
  factors that may impact it and how to mitigate them.
- See Doom's "[[https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/why-is-emacs-doom-slow/83/3][Why is Emacs/Doom slow?]]" write-up, where Doom's author documents
  common factors that can slow Emacs down in general (not specifically to do
  with scrolling) and what to do about them.

If all else fails, let us know on [[https://discourse.doomemacs.org][Discourse]] or [[https://doomemacs.org/discord][Discord]]. Only file an issue if
you have a good idea what's causing the problem or have an explicit error to
report (performance issues, in general, tend to be the result of *many* factors
and are the greatest source of false positives on our issue tracker).
