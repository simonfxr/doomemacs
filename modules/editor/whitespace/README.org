** Module flags
- +guess ::
  Use heuristics to automatically detect and set indent style and width settings
  for non-project files (or all files if ~+whitespace-guess-in-projects~ is set).
- +trim ::
  Automatically strips trailing whitespace at EOL or EOF, but only in regions of
  the file that have been touched in the current session (as to not too
  aggressively adjust whitespace in parts of a codebase you aren't responsible
  for).

** Packages
