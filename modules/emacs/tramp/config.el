;; PERF: When creating a new process in Emacs, you have two options: synchronous
;;   or asynchronous. Async processes have historically been really slow over
;;   TRAMP, because it has to create a new connection for every async process.
;;   However recent version of TRAMP have added a feature called direct async
;;   process that makes this significantly faster. This feature alone will take
;;   many packages (like magit or git-gutter) from completely unusable to
;;   bearable over TRAMP. Here is how you configure it with TRAMP 2.7.
