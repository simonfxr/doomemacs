* Description :unfold:
This module provides sensible and performant defaults for TRAMP, a built-in
Emacs package that provides remote file editing over various protocols like SSH,
SCP, FTP, and more.

#+begin_quote
  The performance enhancements in this module have the greatest effects in
    later versions of Emacs (at least 30.1 is recommended).

** Module flags
/This module has no flags./

** Packages
/This module doesn't install any packages./

** Hacks
- Turns on tramp-direct-async-process globally (for improved performance), but
  disables it for lsp-mode/eglot connections to LSP servers.
- In remote buffers, several functions are memoized to reduce I/O over TRAMP and
  improve performance. Currently, these functions are ~magit-toplevel~,
  ~project-current~, and ~vc-git-root~.
