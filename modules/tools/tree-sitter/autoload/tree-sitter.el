  "Remap major MODES to TS-MODE.

MODES and TS-MODE are major mode symbols. MODES can be a list thereof. If
RECIPES is provided, fall back to MODES if RECIPES don't pass `treesit-ready-p'
when activating TS-MODE. Use this for ts modes that error out instead of failing
gracefully.

RECIPES is a symbol (a grammar language name), list thereof, or alist of plists
with the format (LANG &key URL REV SOURCE-DIR CC CPP COMMIT). If an alist of
plists, it will be transformed into entries for `treesit-language-source-alist'
(which describe what each of these keys mean). Note that COMMIT is ignored
pre-Emacs 31."
